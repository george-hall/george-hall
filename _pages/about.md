I am a computer scientist developing algorithms for the analysis of single-cell RNAseq data. After completing my PhD in computer science, I decided to move fields for my postdoctoral research. I therefore moved to the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child health, the research wing of the world-renowned children's hospital. Since moving here, I have been focussed on the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. In particular, I want to use this technology to develop computational methods for the quality control of regenerative medicine therapies.
