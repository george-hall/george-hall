Before moving to UCL, I was carrying out my PhD in computer science at the University of Sheffield. For it, I conducted theoretical analyses of algorithm configurators, tools that optimise the settings of other algorithms. My research was the first to try to establish a rigorous grounding for these tools and address key questions such as whether a given configurator will ever be able to identify optimal parameter settings for an algrorithm, and, if so, how long will it require to do so. Here is my thesis: https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/29537/1/thesis.pdf. This work led us to the insight that the traditional way of measuring the performance of a configuration of an optimisation algorithm (by measuring the time it takes to reach the optimum of the problem) is problematic, and we proved that a faster approach is to look at the best solution achieved by the configuration within a given time budget. We published these findings in two conference papers and extended the first in a paper published in Artificial Intelligence
